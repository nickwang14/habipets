## Glossary  
- Habit tracker: Log your daily habit of choice or a selected habit that is confirmable. 
- Good/Bad: You can choose between a good habit to build or a bad habit to get rid of, each with their respective NFTs. 
- Competition: You can compete against your friends after putting up collateral or work together to push each other for your goals. 
- Items: Can use freeze items (like Duolingo) to pause your streak in order to not lose it. 
- SmartNFTs: Dynamic NFT with multiple images so we avoid transaction costs with each log and do it off-chain. 
- Minting function: Finally we mint the NFT for the user if they reach their goal time.
